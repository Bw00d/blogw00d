I have wanted a blog for awhile, and oddly I now have three, so I guess you could say I am fat on blogs. I built them each within the past week and I don't plan to keep them all, I'm just not yet sure which one I like the most. Two of them are built with Ruby on Rails and two of them are built with Jekyll. Two of them use markdown and two of them are written by dogs. I'm only going to keep one so we'll see which it will be.

The purpose of the blog is to help me develop a habit of writing daily for the benefits that one who writes daily would expect. Given my lifestyle which has a tendency to get me in situations where I don't have internet access for days or weeks at a time it is unlikely to literally be a _daily_ blog. But I will do my best to post daily when I have access. Stating that, it makes logical sense that quite a lot of what get posted here will probably be crap. I'm ok with that. I think I'm ok with that. We'll see if I am.

So now that you've found your way to this blog I hope it's not a totally waste of time for you. And I hope it wasn't for me.

Let the journal begin!
