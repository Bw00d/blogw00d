I have wanted to get a blog for awhile, and oddly I now have three, so I guess you could say I am fat on blogs. I built them each within the past week and I don't plan to keep them all, I'm just not yet sure which one I like the most. Two of them are built with Ruby on Rails and two of them are built with Jekyll. Two of them use markdown and two of them are written by dogs. Two of them are hosted at Heroku and were built as practice for adding to my app [Firecall](https://www.firecall.org) which means I going to have _another_ blog as soon as I get around to it. But only one will be my personal blog and I have a feeling it's going to be this. 

The purpose of the blog is to help me develop a daily writing habit for the benefits that one who writes daily would expect. Given my lifestyle  which has a tendency to get me in situations where I don't have internet access for days or weeks at a time it is unlikely to literally be a _daily_ blog. But I will do my best to post daily when I have access. Stating that, it makes logical sense that quite a lot of what gets posted here will probably be crap. I'm ok with that. I think I'm ok with that. We'll see if I am.

So now that you've found your way to this blog I hope it's not a total waste of time for you. And I hope it wasn't for me.

Let the journal begin!
